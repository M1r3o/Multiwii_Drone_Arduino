*rev 3 of frame*

this project is made with arduino nano and a GY6521 (MPU6050) and 3D print frame  
I made this project in my second year of high school, the Arduino program was created by french developer, they wanted to created a multicopter with a nunchuck gyroscope  
at over time, their code has evolved offering stability and safety  

## For this project you need 
* ## Distribution Card ( 4 way to connect your 4 ESC at Battery)
* ## Battery 2 or 3 cell (Lipo) 
* ## radiocommand 5 way (minimum)
* ## 4 ESC With UBEC (minimum 1 Ampere)
* ## 4 Motors with a thrust of at least 500 grams (and compatible with your ESC and your battery)
* ## Arduino Nano 
* ## GY521 Gyroscope 
* ## Propellers compatible with your Motor
* ## some connector
* ## a solder breadboard
* ## some connector to connect your system
